# Home Tracker
Service to track parameters from different sources using a TSDB like influxdb or ticktock. I originally created this for weather sensors, but can have other uses.

# Getting started
#### 1. Create .env and schedules.yml files
Copy the corresponding example files and update with your information.
#### 2. Install npm dependencies
Run `npm i` to install the dependencies. This step assumes nodejs and npm are installed.
#### 3. Build project with `npm run build`
#### 4. Run the project with `npm start`
